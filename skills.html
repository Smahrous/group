    <h3>Initial group encounters -</h3>
    <p> As a group, we faced numerous challenges pertaining to the scope of the course. From the beginning, we both were
        grouped together randomly but eventually understood how to work cooperatively. First, we were given the task of
        understanding how to work collaboratively using webstorm. At first, this was difficult, since we both had not had
        previous experience using it, but we eventually learned how to leverage the software to complete our tasks. The
        initial task we received was creating a timeline of the internet. This was after we viewed the the video that our
        professor showed us during class. This also involved making a list of commands we learned during class. I felt that
        this was practical because it put the skills we learned to work.

    <h3>More complex group work -</h3>
    <p>
        Moving on, we eventually had to work on more complex projects, which involved collaborating more efficiently with the
        use of git and slack. This entailed us using the push and pull features on webstorm, so that our commits could be seen by
        each other as well as the professor. The next project we had to do was create a guide on how to utilize the features we learned.
        This was another chancce for us to put our skills on display. This was not only helpful, but practical as well.

    <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
    <p>
        In conclusion, the IS117 class taught us much about our partners but also about ourselves. We learned how to work
        together while utiilizing our html and css codes which helped prepare us for on the job experiences. There were times when
        our group had conflicts but we always eventually resolved it. This was important because I personally want to pursue a
        career involving web and or information systems to work for companies as well as myself. In the future, using this
        type of teaching method I think will benefit students, and help them learn the way in which we were able to.
